### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt unprepared to define all of the routes and CRUD functions.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I currently am using the sample's backend, because I could not successfully integrate my own. I plan to fix this by the end of the night, or at least at some point tomorrow.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

We did not yet demo our projects.

### Shout out

David and Cristobal were incredibly helpful in pointing me in the right direction when I approached with several miscellaneous bugs.
